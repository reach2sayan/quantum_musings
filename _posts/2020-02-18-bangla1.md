<p>নমস্কার !! (Hello in Bengali) , This is Christina (ক্রিস্টিনা) and Sayan (সায়ন), graduate students at the Data Science Initiative, Brown University¹ . As a part of the coursework for DATA 2040 — Deep Learning and Advanced Topics in Data Science, we are working on the Kaggle Competition: Bengali.AI Handwritten Grapheme Classification.</p>

<p>Bengali² (used synonymous to Bangla) ranks in the top 5 spoken languages with more than hundreds of millions of speakers. It is the official language of Bangladesh³ and is the second most spoken language in India (after Hindi). The language has a total of 40 consonants and 10 vowels at its base. However, there can be conjunctive words, which are formed by joining a pair of consonant/vowel (known together as grapheme root). Further additions in the form of another vowel and/or consonant can be achieved by composing the grapheme root with yet another vowel or consonant accent (synonymous to diacritic). This, in total, form a Grapheme.</p>

> Grapheme = Grapheme root + vowel diacritic + consonant diacritic.

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
