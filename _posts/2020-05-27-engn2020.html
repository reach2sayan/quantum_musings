<p>This post in based on the syllabus of <b>ENGN 2020 - Mathematical Methods in Engineering and Physics II</b> offered during the Spring semester at Brown University, RI, USA. </p>

<p> ENGN 2020 is an extensive course on the application of a wide spectrum of numerical techniques that can be used to solve real-life engineering problems. Unfortunately, due the large syllabus, the utility of the lessons learnt in this course can often be underestimated or forgotten. In this post we shall look at a Materials science phenomena known as Spinodal Decomposition, which can be mathematically modeled by the Cahn-Hilliard Equation. The algorithm demonstrated below is borrowed from the work done by Dr. Saswata Bhattacharya and colleagues at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISC).</p>

<p> However, the details of the particular computer experiment is not the primary take-away here, rather, the application of apparently disconnected mathematical topics in tandem that leads to the physically comparable results is what's important and shall be stressed upon.</p>
